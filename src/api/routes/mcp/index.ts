/**
 * MCP HTTP Route
 *
 * Serves a Model Context Protocol server over Streamable HTTP at /api/mcp.
 *
 * The transport is stateless (sessionIdGenerator: undefined) — a fresh
 * transport is created per request. This is the simplest model for a
 * starter and avoids sticky session concerns.
 *
 * Security — Origin validation (DNS rebinding / cross-site protection):
 *   The MCP spec REQUIRES HTTP servers to validate the Origin header to
 *   prevent DNS-rebinding attacks, where a malicious web page the victim
 *   visits POSTs to the (often unauthenticated, sometimes localhost) MCP
 *   endpoint from the victim's browser and invokes tools. The app's global
 *   CORS reflects any origin with credentials, so without this guard any
 *   web page could reach this endpoint cross-site.
 *
 *   Legitimate MCP clients (Claude Desktop, IDE/CLI plugins, the Inspector
 *   proxy) are Node-based and send NO Origin header, so this guard does not
 *   affect them: requests with no Origin pass through. Only browser-issued
 *   cross-site requests (which always carry an Origin) are rejected unless
 *   the origin is explicitly allowlisted via MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
 *   (comma-separated). Default allowlist is empty → all browser origins are
 *   rejected, which is the correct posture for a headless server.
 *
 * Wire-up (in app.ts):
 *   import { mcpRoutes } from "@/api/routes/mcp/index.ts";
 *   app.route("/api/mcp", mcpRoutes);
