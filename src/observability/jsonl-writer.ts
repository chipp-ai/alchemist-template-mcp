/**
 * Append-only JSONL writer for the unified observability stream.
 *
 * File location: `<workspace>/.scratch/logs/observability.jsonl`
 *
 * The file is the single context ball that an AI agent (e.g. the
 * Alchemist Local Dev window's orchestrator) consults after a user
 * test session. Server-side log events, HTTP request records, and
 * client breadcrumbs ALL converge here in time order. Format is
 * standard JSONL — one JSON object per line, append-only.
 *
 * Rotation: at 10 MB the active file is renamed to
 *   observability.<unix-ms>.jsonl
 * and a fresh empty file is started. Keeps long dev sessions from
 * bloating the workspace AND gives the agent a clean "most recent
 * session" file to read.
 *
 * Concurrency: a single process writes (Deno) — synchronous append
 * is fine for dev volume. Errors are swallowed; observability must
 * NEVER block or break the app it's instrumenting.
 *
 * Production: this module is no-op'd when NODE_ENV === "production"
 * (the recordObsEvent caller checks ENV). When the analytics product
 * ships, the same call sites will route to a remote ingest instead.
