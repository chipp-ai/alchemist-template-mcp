/**
 * Debounced push pipeline for the dev panel.
 *
 * Subscribes to every registered store via `subscribeAll`. When ANY
 * top-level write happens, schedules a debounced (1s) POST to
 * `/api/dev/app-state` with the current snapshot. Also pushes on:
 *
 *   - hashchange (route navigation)
 *   - resize (viewport changes)
 *   - 5s heartbeat (catches nested mutations the proxy doesn't see)
 *
 * No-op in production. The dev API endpoint is gated server-side
 * (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`), so even if this somehow ran in prod
 * it would 404. Adding the client-side gate is defense-in-depth: it
 * means production bundles don't bother to compile this code path
 * (Vite tree-shakes the body when `import.meta.env.PROD` is true).
 *
 * Heartbeat rationale (the 5s number)
 *
 *   - Top-level proxy writes are caught immediately and debounce 1s.
 *   - Nested mutations like `state.user.name = "X"` go through Svelte's
 *     deep $state proxy for component reactivity but DON'T trip our
 *     top-level subscriber. The CLAUDE.md rule asks customers to do
 *     whole-object updates instead, but agents don't always follow
 *     it perfectly.
 *   - 5s heartbeat is the safety net: any change is visible to the
 *     dev panel within 5s even when the rule is broken.
 *   - Cost: one fetch per 5s during dev = trivial.
